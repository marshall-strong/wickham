# TAYLOR Model 8754 Ice Cream Machine

![TAYLOR Model 8754-27](files/Taylor8754/Taylor8754_Photo.jpeg)

As of Sumer 2021, this machine is currently located in the Bakery in the Main Barn.

All ice cream machines must be disassembled, cleaned, and sanitized at least twice a week. Ideally this should be done at the end of the day with enough time for the machine to air dry and be reassembled and refilled before employees go home for the evening.

## DRAINING PRODUCT

All ice cream mix must be emptied out of the machines before they can be cleaned. To avoid waste, extra ice cream is drained into 32 quart containers and frozen for later in the walk-in freezer. 32 quart plastic containers are stored upstairs in the Main Barn.

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Ice cream in the machine at the time of cleaning should be drained into a 32 quart plastic container. Open the spigot on the machine like you normally would, and fill 32 quart containers until the ice cream stops flowing readily. Once filled, 32 quart containers should be stored in the walk-in freezer by the Shop or in the Food Barn freezer. Stop filling 32 quart containers once the ice cream is no longer flowing readily.

2. Press the AUTO button to stop the compressor and the beater motor.

3. Press the MIX REF button to shut off the hopper's mix refrigeration system.

4. Remove the hopper cover and gasket. Take these parts to the sink for cleaning.

5. Place the red bucket below the hopper's spout, then press the WASH and PUMP buttons.

6. Pull down on the draw handle to drain the remaining ice cream mix out of the hopper and freezing cylinder and into the red bucket. When the flow of ice cream mix stops, close the draw valve and press the WASH and PUMP buttons.

## RINSING HOPPERS

Before the machine can be properly cleaned and sanitized, all ice cream mix remaining in the hoppers and freezing cylinders must be flushed out with water.

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Fill the red plastic bucket with 8 quarts (2 gallons) of cool tap water.

2. Pour the water into the hopper, then press the WASH button for the hopper you are working on. This will initiate a cleaning cycle where the auger spins to help melt any ice cream mix still in the machine.

3. While the WASH cycle is running, use a brush or rag to clean off any ice cream that is stuck to the sides of the hopper, the mix inlet hole, and the mix level sensing probe.

4. After a few minutes, open the spigot and drain the water into the 8 quart red plastic sanitizer bucket. Once the water has stopped flowing, press the WASH button to turn off the auger. Discard the water in the three basin sink, then rinse out the red plastic sanitizer bucket.

5. If the water flowing out of the hopper is not clear, repeat steps 1-5 as many times as necessary until the water draining into the bucket is no longer milky.

## SANITIZING HOPPERS

When sanitizing the inside of the ice cream machine, it is important to use the **Stera Sheen Green Label Sanitizer & Cleaner (Milkstone Remover)** and **NOT** the normal Sanibet sanitizer that is dispensed at the three basin sinks. The dairy in ice cream mix causes mineral salts to build up in our ice cream machines -- these mineral deposits are called milkstone, and they require a special chemical in order to be removed (hence the Stera Sheen).

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Fill a large red sanitizer bucket with 8 quarts of hot water, then add one 2 oz. scoop of Stera-Sheen sanitizing mix and stir.

2. Pour the sanitizer solution into the hopper.

3. Press the WASH button to start the auger in the freezing cylinder.

4. While the WASH cycle is running, use a sponge or rag to wipe down the inside walls of the hopper to make sure that all ice cream mix is removed and that the solution sanitizes the entire hopper. Make sure to get around the mix inlet hole and the mix level sensing probe.

5. Press the WASH button again after 5 minutes to stop the cleaning cycle. Place the red bucket back under the spigot.

6. Open the spigot and allow the sanitizing solution to drain out of the hopper and freezing tube and into the bucket.

7. As soon as the lid to the hopper is washed and dried, place it back over the hopper to prevent any contaminates from falling into the freshly sanitized hopper.

## DISASSEMBLING

Pro Tip: When taking the machine apart for cleaning, keep the disassembled parts in one of the dishwasher racks (the kind without pegs) to avoid losing any.

1. Flip the power switch to the OFF position. Ensure that no lights are lit on the control panel.

2. Remove the front drip tray and the splash shield, and take to the sink for cleaning.

3. Unscrew the four knobs/hand-screws that hold the freezer door assembly in place.

4. Remove the freezer door assembly by pulling it forward off of the studs, and take it to the sink for cleaning.

5. Remove the beaters, beater shoes, scraper blades, and drive shafts from inside the freezing cylinders, and take them to the sink for cleaning.

6. Remove the drive shafts from the drive hubs in the rear wall of the mix hoppers and take to the sink for cleaning.

7. Remove any design caps from the ends of the door spouts.

8. Remove the long pivot pin from the freezer door assembly that holds the three draw handles in place.

9. Remove the three metal draw handles by pulling them out of the slots in the three draw valves.

10. Remove the three draw valves (one for each handle) by pushing them DOWN and out of the front assembly.

11. Remove the two prime plugs (one for each freezing cylinder) by pulling them UP and out of the top of the front assembly.

12. The freezer door assembly has two sets of baffle rods that protrude out the back of the assembly; one set for each freezing cylinder. Slide each of the white plastic bearings off the ends of the baffle rods.

13. Remove the two large black rubber gaskets (big o-rings) from their grooves on the back side of the freezer door assembly.

## CLEANING

1. Set up a three basin sink with the normal wash, rinse, and sanitize stations. The normal Sanibet Sanitizer that is dispensed from the sink is fine (no need to to use the Stera Sheen Sanitizer this time).

2. Use a sponge to wash all of the disassembled parts in the 3 basin sink. Make sure to remove all lubricant from the o-rings and their parts.

3. Sanitize the disassembled parts in the Sanibet Sanitizer. They must remain in the solution for at least 5 minutes, then be allowed to air dry. All parts must be fully dry before the machine can be reassembled.

4. Fill a large red sanitizer bucket with 8 quarts of hot water, then add one 2 oz. scoop of Stera-Sheen sanitizing mix and stir to create Stera-Sheen sanitizing soluiton.

5. Use the Stera-Sheen sanitizing solution and a clean dish towel to wipe down and sanitize the inside of the freezing cylinder.

6. Use the Stera-Sheen sanitizing solution and a clean dish towel to wipe down all exterior surfaces of the ice cream machine.

7. Use a clean, dry towel to wipe the exterior of the machine dry.

## REASSEMBLING

Ideally, ice cream machines should be reassembled and refilled the same day they are cleaned and sanitized, after the ice cream machine and the disassembled parts have been given time to air dry. This will give the ice cream time to freeze overnight.
