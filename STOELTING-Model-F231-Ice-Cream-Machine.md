# STOELTING Model F231 Ice Cream Machine

![STOELTING Model F231](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_machine.png)

As of Summer 2021, this machine is currently located in **Shakes & Cakes** in the **Food Barn**.

[The information in this documentation is from the [STOELTING Model F231 Service Manual](files/manuals/stoelting_f231_service_manual.pdf).

All ice cream machines must be disassembled, cleaned, and sanitized at least twice a week. Ideally this should be done at the end of the day with enough time for the machine to air dry and be reassembled and refilled before employees go home for the evening.

## DRAINING PRODUCT

All ice cream mix must be emptied out of the machines before they can be cleaned. To avoid waste, extra ice cream is drained into 32 quart containers and frozen for later in the walk-in freezer. 32 quart plastic containers are stored upstairs in the Main Barn.

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Ice cream in the machine at the time of cleaning should be drained into a 32 quart plastic container. Open the spigot on the machine like you normally would, and fill 32 quart containers until the ice cream stops flowing readily. Once filled, 32 quart containers should be stored in the walk-in freezer by the Shop or in the Food Barn freezer.

2. Once the ice cream is no longer flowing readily, stop filling the 32 quart containers. Open the lid of the hopper and remove the mix inlet assembly (see image). Set it aside to be cleaned later.

![mix inlet assembly](./files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_MixInletAssembly.png)

3. Press the CLEAN button for the hopper you are working on (see image). This will start a 5 minute cleaning cycle where the auger spins to help melt any ice cream mix still in the machine. Let the machine run for the entire 5 minute cycle.

![IntelliTec2 controls](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_IntelliTec2Controls.png)

4. The CLEAN cycle should stop automatically after 5 minutes. Open the spigots and drain any remaining ice cream mix into the 8 quart red plastic sanitizer bucket. Discard the ice cream mix in the three basin sink, then rinse out the red plastic sanitizer bucket.

## RINSING HOPPERS

Before the machine can be properly cleaned and sanitized, all ice cream mix remaining in the hoppers and freezing cylinders must be flushed out with water.

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Fill the red plastic bucket with 8 quarts (2 gallons) of cool tap water.

2. Pour the water into the hopper, then press the CLEAN button to initiate a 5 minute cleaning cycle.

3. While the CLEAN cycle is running, use a brush or rag to clean off any ice cream that is stuck to the sides of the hopper.

4. Once the CLEAN cycle ends, open the spigots and drain all of the water out of the hopper and into the red plastic bucket.

5. If the water flowing out of the hopper is not clear, repeat steps 1-5 as many times as necessary until the water draining into the bucket is no longer milky.

6. If a hopper needs another CLEAN cycle run but the machine says 'MAXIMUM CLEANING TIME REACHED', try turning the hopper off and on again.

## SANITIZING HOPPERS

When sanitizing the inside of the ice cream machine, it is important to use the **Stera Sheen Green Label Sanitizer & Cleaner (Milkstone Remover)** and **NOT** the normal Sanibet sanitizer that is dispensed at the three basin sinks. The dairy in ice cream mix causes mineral salts to build up in our ice cream machines -- these mineral deposits are called milkstone, and they require a special chemical in order to be removed (hence the Stera Sheen).

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Fill a large red sanitizer bucket with 8 quarts of hot water, then add one 2 oz. scoop of Stera-Sheen sanitizing mix and stir.

2. Pour the sanitizer solution into the hopper.

3. Press the CLEAN button to start the auger in the freezing cylinder.

4. While the CLEAN cycle is running, use a sponge or rag to wipe down the inside walls of the hopper to make sure that all ice cream mix is removed and that the solution sanitizes the entire hopper. Make sure to get around the mix level probe.

5. Once the CLEAN cycle stops after 5 minutes, open the spigots and drain the sanitizing solution back into the 8 quart red bucket.

6. Once the solution has drained, press the CLEAN button to stop the auger. Place the red bucket back under the spigot and allow any remaining water in the freezing cylinder to drain completely.

7. Wash the hopper lid in the dishwasher. As soon as the lid is dry, recover the hopper to prevent any contaminates from falling into the freshly sanitized hopper.

## DISASSEMBLING

When taking the machine apart for cleaning, keep the disassembled parts in one of the dishwasher racks (the kind without pegs) to avoid losing any.

### Disassembling the Front Door

![Front Door Assembly ](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_FrontDoorAssembly.png)

1. Turn the machine off by pressing the Power Off/On button.

2. Remove the 4 black **Knobs** holding the front door in place.

3. Remove the **Front Door Assembly** by pulling it forward off of the **Pins**.

4. Remove the three **Spigot Bodies** from the front door assembly by pushing them up through the holes in the bottom of the assembly and out the holes in the top.

5. Remove all o-rings from the parts by first wiping the lubrication off with a towel, then by rolling the o-ring out of its groove (see image). There is 1 **Red Front Door O-Ring** is located on the rear side of the front door assembly; 4 **Outer Spigot O-Rings** located on the 2 **Outer Spigot Bodies**; and 3 **Middle Spigot O-Rings** located on the **Middle Spigot Body**.

### Disassembling the Auger Shaft

![Auger Shaft ](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231AugerShaft.png)

**Repeat these steps for each of the machine's two hoppers/freezing cylinders**

1. Remove the **Front Auger Support** and **Front Auger Support Bushing**.

2. Remove the **Auger Shaft** assembly from the freezing tube by slowly pulling the auger out of the machine barrel. As the auger is being pulled out, carefully remove each of the four plastic **Auger Flights** and their attached **Auger Flight Springs**. Pull the auger shaft part way out and remove the first two flights, then pull the shaft the rest of the way out and remove the second two flights.

3. Once the auger is out, remove the **Rear Auger Seal** and the **Rear Seal O-Ring** from the other end of the auger shaft.

## CLEANING

1. Remove the **Drip Tray** and the 2 **Drain Trays** from the machine (see image). They can be washed by hand or in the dishwasher.

![Drip Tray and Drain Tray](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_DripTray_DrainTray.png)

2. Set up a three basin sink with the normal wash, rinse, and sanitize stations. The normal Sanibet Sanitizer that is dispensed from the sink is fine (no need to to use the Stera Sheen Sanitizer this time).

![ProFill Chemical Dispenser for 3 Basin Sinks](files/ProFillChemicalDispenser.jpg)

2. Use a sponge to wash all of the other disassembled parts of the **Front Door** and **Auger Shaft** assemblies in the 3 basin sink. Make sure to remove all lubricant from the o-rings and their parts. Also wash the **Mix Inlet Assembly** you removed from the hopper earlier.

3. Sanitize the disassembled parts in the Sanibet Sanitizer. They must remain in the solution for at least 5 minutes, then be allowed to air dry. All parts must be fully dry before the machine can be reassembled.

4. Fill a large red sanitizer bucket with 8 quarts of hot water, then add one 2 oz. scoop of Stera-Sheen sanitizing mix and stir to create Stera-Sheen sanitizing soluiton.

5. Use the Stera-Sheen sanitizing solution and a clean dish towel to wipe down and sanitize the inside of the freezing cylinder.

6. Use the Stera-Sheen sanitizing solution and a clean dish towel to wipe down all exterior surfaces of the ice cream machine.

7. Use a clean, dry towel to wipe the exterior of the machine dry.

## REASSEMBLING

Ideally, ice cream machines should be reassembled and refilled the same day they are cleaned and sanitized, after the ice cream machine and the disassembled parts have been given time to air dry. This will give the ice cream time to freeze overnight.

1. There are 8 o-rings that are a part of the **Front Door** assembly: 1 **Red Front Door O-Ring** that goes on the rear side of the front door assembly; 4 **Outer Spigot O-Rings** that go on the 2 **Outer Spigot Bodies**; and 3 **Middle Spigot O-Rings** that go on the **Middle Spigot Body**. Roll all o-rings onto their parts dry, without any lubrication. Once each o-ring is in the right place, apply a thin film of sanitary lubricant to the exposed surface of the o-ring.

2. Apply lubricant for the **Rear Seal O-Ring** to the end of the **Auger Shaft** (the spot on the auger shaft where the rear seal o-ring will sit once the machine is reassembled) (see image).

![Rear Seal Assembly](files/StoeltingF231/StoeltingF231_RearSealAssembly.png)

3. Roll the **Rear Seal O-Ring** onto the end of the **Auger Shaft**.

4. Lubricate the inside of the **Rear Auger Seal** (the part that will touch the **Rear Seal O-Ring**) and slide it onto the end of the **Auger Shaft**. Do NOT apply lubricant the outside of the rear auger seal.

5. Lubricate the hex drive end of the **Auger Shaft** with a small amount of lubricant.

6. Make sure the **Auger Flight Springs** are all firmly screwed onto their studs on the 4 **Auger Flights**. The springs must be screwed into the flights completely to provide proper compression.

7. Install the first two **Auger Flights** onto the back of the **Auger Shaft**, and and insert the whole assembly part way into the freezing cylinder (until the auger flights won't fall off the auger shaft).

8. Install the two remaining **Auger Flights**, then push the auger shaft into the freezing cylinder and rotate slowly it until you feel the hex end engage the drive shaft.

9. Apply a thin layer of sanitary lubricant to the inside and outside of the **Front Auger Support Bushing** and install it on the end of the **Front Auger Support**.

10. Install the **Front Auger Support** with the **Front Auger Support Bushing** on it into the front of the auger. Rotate the front auger support so that one leg points straight up. All three legs of the front auger support should fit within the freezing cylinder

10. Apply a thin layer of sanitary lubricant to the o-rings on the 3 **Spigot Bodies**, then install the **Spigot Bodies** in the **Front Door** assembly through the bottom of the front door.

11. Apply a thin film of sanitary lubricant to the **Red Front Door O-Ring** and fit it into the groove on the back side of the front door.

11. Place the **Front Door Assembly** on the mounting **Pins**, then carefully push the front door against the machine. If everything has been reassembled correctly, you should be able to thread all four **Knobs** onto the ends of the **Pins** without any issues.

12. Secure the front door assembly to the machine by placing the **Knobs** on the ends of the **Pins** and tightening until finger tight. Do not overtighten. When properly sealed, the **Red Front Door O-Ring** should be visible through the transparent front door.

13. Insert the **Mix Inlet Assembly** back into its hole in the bottom of the hopper.

## REFILLING

1. Only refill the ice cream machine once it has been properly cleaned, sanitized, allowed to air dry, and reassembled.

2. Make sure the display shows the freezing cylinder is off. If it is not, press the On/Off Left or On/Off Right button to turn it off.

3. Fill the hopper with at least 2.5 gallons of soft-serve ice cream mix.

4. Place a container under the spigot and open the spigot to drain ~8 oz. of mix out of the machine. This will allow the ice cream mix to flush out any sanitizing solution that may still remain in the machine.

5. Press the On/Off button to turn on the freezing cylinder.

6. Press the PUSH TO FREEZE button.

7. Once the ice cream in the machine is at 75% consistency, the display will change to read "SERVE". At this point you may open the spigot and begin to dispense product.
