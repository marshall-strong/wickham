7. Carefully slide the faucet valve up to remove the spring and faucet seal. Extra care should be taken when handling the seal to prevent damage. Do not fold the seal as this will cause damage to the Teflon sealing surface.

10. Place all parts in a clean sink with mild hot water (120°F) and sanitizer solution. Allow all parts to soak for at least 5 minutes. Carefully wash all components with a clean wash cloth in the hot water and sanitizer solution. Use a clean, soft bristle brush as needed for the smaller components and tight areas. Do not immerse hopper lids. Use a commercial sanitizer that has 100 ppm of available chlorine with a concentration level of at least 3% available chlorine (KAY-5 Sanitizer). Follow the sanitizer’s mixing instructions to ensure 100 ppm of available chlorine.

11. Wash the drums, hopper drip trays, top covers, and outer enclosure using a clean wash cloth that has been dampened in the hot water and sanitizer solution. Pay particular attention to the shaft area and make sure it is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.

12. Thoroughly rinse all surfaces with a clean wash cloth that has been dampened with hot water. Wipe dry with a clean dry wash cloth before reassembling the dispenser.

* NOTE – Although most parts are dishwasher safe, they may be affected by the chemicals in some commercial sanitizing agents. Do not place the hopper nor hopper lids in a dishwasher. Rinse thoroughly before assembly
